# Follow-up Questions
1- How long did you spend on the test?  
Around 14 hours (over two days), including time for environment setup, application development, automated unit testing
and manual integration testing.

2- What would you add if you had more time?  
Some possible improvements would be:
- Option to edit basket contents (update quantities, remove items)
- Display information about promotions as part of the list of products
 
3- How would you improve the product APIs that you had to consume?  
Some possible improvements would be:
- Common representation for all promotions, with standard names for fields
- Simpler representation of the promotion types (enum), tied to actual documentation about promotion mechanics
- Add an API to retrieve all existing instances of promotions at once and only reference them by ID in the product details later
 
4- What did you find most difficult?  
I think the no specific part of the challenge was particularly more difficult than the rest, but if I had to point one specific pain point, was the interpretation of the expected behavior of each promotion type

5- How did you find the overall experience, any feedback for us?  
This was a very interesting format for a coding challenge, that allowed me to express many different skills
related to real-world SW development work, instead of having to rush through trick questions and focusing only on
algorithms and/or memorized programming language syntax and attributes like usual coding challenges performed during
selection processes.
On the other side, this challenge took much longer than usual, and required me to worry about a lot more detail than
usual.
However, I think that the overall experience was very positive and I felt more comfortable and confident in my results and the work I could present than compared to other coding challenges I've taken in the past.
